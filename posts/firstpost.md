When the sky opened, the rain came. 
Water destroyed what we made
The house was filled
Some dreams were killed
As our belongings started to fade

When the sky closed, the pain came.
Igniting the fear from the past
Flooding the ground
Destroying the town
A reminder that nothing will last.

When the sky opens, the rain comes
A reminder of what was once ours
Days turned to years
We learned from our fears
We healed but still there are scars

When the sky closes, the light shines
reminding us of pain that subsides
some memories sad
others, not bad
but peace is whats left behind.

When the sky opens, the rain comes.
Watering the ground to bring growth
Beauty does follow,
as the world seems less hollow
Bringing new life from the earth.
