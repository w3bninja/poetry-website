Echoes within filter out the sound to the point that I cant hear the tears falling down to the bottom of an empty soul filled with a fear that is out of control spiraling through an endless abyss yet caught up in the things im not wanting to miss though I do because there is no way to see the things locked inside and the truth about me is that there is no more to this mystery because when you understand my mind you understand me.
