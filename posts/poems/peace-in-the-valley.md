Worried about nothing
Helpless to move on
Looking to another
To make the worry all seem gone

Looking to the Father
To find strength to pass right through
Hoping to discover
Yourself inside the blue

Needing a way to lighten
The heavy load you have just made
The stress is over taking
Your mind you want to trade

Trade for a better one
With things already worked out
Or maybe you'll just keep this one
And just loose the worry and doubt
