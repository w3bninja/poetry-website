its coming out of the crowd and giving your heart
its loving the ones that have torn you apart
its helping the broken and finding the true
its giving more of yourself and keeping less of you

its not robbing from the rich to give to the poor
or defiance of the government that knocks on your door
its not hurting people because of the pain they've caused you
or remembering their past when they've change and are new

its whats more real to me then it ever has been
through the blood and the nails He carried the sin
the weight of the world was laid on his back
as He carried the load and he heard the whips crack

its following His heart as hung on the tree
and realizing he was there so we could be free
its so we would have a chance to make the right choice
its so His word could be heard because we are His voice
