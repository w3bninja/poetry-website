my eyes burn this night
as i see only you

and i sit in this light
as i fade into blue

my heart breaks in two
when its out on my sleeve

your loves always true
and you made me believe

i transformed my eyes
to a dreamers remorse

i held onto love
and was thrown from my course

now back, here i am
on the path i once walked

and back in the place
where God and i talked

here i will stay
till His day of return

this choice i have made
and now its your turn
