i look at my rhymes and my past
and i thought those feelings would always last

I never saw my failing love
as a ending spectrum from above

it seemed so perfect and so new
i turned to red from black and blue

i hesitated when it was done
because i thought it had just begun

i wanted to make it clean and neat
but broke when i heard of her retreat

i knew the day would never last
and then i looked back to the past

i saw the things i had been through
and to the list i added you

you taught me things i never knew
i learned things i could only learn from you

i look back now and i must insure
the biggest effect was my character

we go through life not knowing things
but prepare for the things that all life brings

in the end when we see the truth
we may hang on both nail and tooth

but remember life will still proceed
because what i once had i no longer need

i grew up, moved on, found life again
and through all these things you remained my friend
