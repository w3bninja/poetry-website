Though the wages of sin is death
we choose to take another breath,
we take another stride
for nothing more than pride.

To make another buck,
with which we're so love struck,
we stand and fight with those
whose emptiness only grows.

We never realize
there was a race, there was a prize.
There was a man up on a tree
to give us life for free.

All we had to do was look
to see the love it took
to know the weight of sin
and destroy the hold within.

A love that will consume
the heart of a groom.
A love He cannot hide
His love of His bride.
