when you look at how life begins and ends
you relize between there are many friends
friends will come and friends will go
but through it all you should always know
that there is one friend that will always be
He is there for you and there for me
He make us know he will never leave
and all He asks is that we believe
so when your going through a trying time
relize Jesus is there right by your side
hes always there and will never leave
and he cares for you even when you cant see
