tomorrow is always a day away
when the trouble is today

hoping for a better tomorrow
it still wont come this way

i try looking to the horizon
but there i always find

tomorrow is always a day away
when today is left behind

saving things for tomorrow
why finish them today

after all is said and done
tomorrows another day

but will tomorrow reach here and now
while we live our life this way it cant become more than it was
when its always a day away
