Im sorry for the imperfections
Im sorry for the loss
Im sorry for not saying hello
when our paths do cross
Im sorry for the hurt
Im sorry for the rain
Im sorry I wasnt there
when you were filled with so much pain
I hope that i can make it
better than it was
If I cant I hope your happy
and that you find the one you love
and if you never find him
I will still be here
with my hand out to hold
to comfort you in your fear.
