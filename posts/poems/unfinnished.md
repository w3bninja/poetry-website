silent whispers in my ear
i know what they mean but i cannot hear
the words are silent but yet so bright
they pass threw the cold and the dead of night
they make you feel the truth that lies
just beyond those mournful cries
they fill you up to unbelief
and return you to the point of grief
the mind will find a truth to see
and you will find your way to be
