The brightness of the day thats gone
is shining through the clouds
The longing of the day to come
burns off every shroud
the willingness to move on
will one day find your face
the love that once burned bright inside
you'll once again embrace
The heart that once was ripped apart
will trust the love once more
but still the love will linger on
and pierce your very core
