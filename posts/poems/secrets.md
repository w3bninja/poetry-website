Is there a place inside of you that no one knows about? A place that you hide all your fears and never let them out. All your secrets all your pain and all of your regrets. You keep them all bottled up so maybe you’ll forget. But how can you forget the mistakes that made you who you are? All of those are things that brought you thus far. If you can’t remember who you are and where you’ve been. Then you will be left standing with your soul blowing in the wind. Tattered and torn from all the secrets and pains you fall on your knees from the weight of your shames. Not knowing that there is a way of reprieve. You don’t understand that all you have to do is believe. Believe in the cross and what Jesus did there and no more will you be left standing there. Just fall on your knees and admit to the truth and follow God’s words without your reproof. He died for us so that we could live free. Not only for you but also for me. So search the place inside that only you know and give it to God, let it all go. If you do all of this then you will understand. The words of The God and the death of The Man.
