it bleeds when its broken
hurts when it bleeds
and feels all the pains of
the one that it needs

it makes anger subside
and the pains go away
with the turns of the tides
it reveals the true way

its beauty is endless
and makes the world seem so new
and i only can think
of my future with you

it doesnt make sence
the way that i feel
but its the way that i feel
that makes life seem so real

your mind is so perfect
as i dream of the rest
ill try calming it down
as it beats out my chest

its makes the world seem
like its falling apart
but in the end what is true
is that it is my heart
