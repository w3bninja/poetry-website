its hard feeling like i want to cry
but not knowing how or knowing why
i wish sometime the tears would flow
but then i sit there and they just wont go
i feel the pain inside my mind
its full of hurt and things i cant find
the answers i wish would just come
i sit there and think im overrun
i need a way to ease the pain
to take away the guilt and shame
i need to cry but i cant
its like lifes a bird and im the ant
