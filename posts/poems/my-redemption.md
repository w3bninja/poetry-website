my heart cant take the breaking
from this earth thats always shaking

moving my feet from under me
my world just starts its quaking

the world keeps moving faster
i dont know if i can last here

sometimes it more than i can take
im just trying to get past here

i hope this cant go higher
while im walking on this wire

as i look down, its all around
i see an ever burning fire

im wanting to escape this
see that beyond the pearly gate is

a God who washes all sins away
and drys tears on all the faces

a love without condition
to live within conviction

this is the life of which i strive
living in the great commission

praising the one above me
and knowing HE still loves me

died so we could live life anew
and there is no one above HE.
