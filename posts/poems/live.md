dream like nothing hurts you there
see the things that you don't fear
love the ones you learned to hate
trust beyond the pearly gate
live with all intentions good
make sure that your understood
view your life in others eyes
and feel the flutter of butterflies
see the path of least distraction
find the peace beyond the action
realize truth will find your face
and live in Gods mercy and His grace
